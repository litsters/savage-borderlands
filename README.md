# Savage Borderlands Server and App
## Overview
This project contains the code to run a java server and a simple web app that help a GM and players run the Savage Borderlands RPG.

## Setup
This project has no framework, which is by design.  It's not intended for anyone else to do development work on this project, especially the Java server.

After cloning, open bash and do the following to run the server:

1. Change directories to the directory housing the project.
2. Execute the following command: rserver run 8080

The program will then output confirmation that the server is running.  If you want to run on a different port, just type the number of the desired port instead of 8080.  8080 is the default, and if you enter an invalid number this is the one the server will run on.
